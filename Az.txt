1 Q. Types of instances offerd by azure

General Purpose: These VMs are like all-rounders. Theyâ€™re good for everyday tasks, like running websites or small databases, because they have a balanced amount of CPU power 
and memory.

Compute Optimized: These VMs are designed for tasks that need a lot of processing power, like handling heavy computations or running complex applications. They have more 
CPU power compared to memory.

Memory Optimized: These VMs are built to handle lots of data at once, making them great for applications that need a lot of memory, like big databases or applications that
work with large amounts of data.

2 Q. How do you setup azure VM?

To set up an Azure VM:

1. **Create the VM**: Use the Azure portal to select the VM size, operating system, and configuration settings.
2. **Configure Network and Security**: Set up network options, firewalls, and security groups to control access.
3. **Deploy and Connect**: Start the VM and connect to it via Remote Desktop (for Windows) or SSH (for Linux) to manage and use it.

This process provisions a virtual machine on Azure, tailored to your needs and accessible for further configuration.

3 Q. Diffrence between scaleset and availability set?

Availability Set ensures your VMs stay up and running during hardware failures by spreading them across different servers.

Scale Set automatically adjusts the number of VMs based on current demand, like adding more workers when things get busy. While Availability Set focuses on reliability, 
Scale Set focuses on flexibility and scaling.

Question.4 What are iaas, paas, saas?

IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) provides basic computing resources like virtual machines and storage, letting you build and manage your own software.

PaaS (Platform as a Service) offers a ready-made environment to develop, run, and manage applications without worrying about the underlying infrastructure. 

SaaS (Software as a Service) delivers fully functional applications over the internet that you can use directly, like email or office software, without managing anything
behind the scenes.

Question.5) What is Public private and hybrid cloud?

Public Cloud is like renting space on a shared server, where multiple users use the same resources over the internet.

Private Cloud is like having your own dedicated server that only you and your organization use.

Hybrid Cloud combines both, allowing you to use both public and private clouds to get the best of both worlds, like having a shared workspace and a private office.

Question.6) How to do we perform connectivity in between Vm if they are in different subscription.

To connect VMs in different Azure subscriptions, you can set up a Virtual Network Peering or use a VPN Gateway. Virtual Network Peering links networks directly, 
while a VPN Gateway creates a secure connection over the internet. Both methods allow VMs to communicate across subscriptions as if they were on the same network.
============================================================================================================================================================================
Question.7)  why you are using application gateway as entrypoint?

Using an Application Gateway as an entry point helps manage and direct web traffic efficiently. It acts like a traffic manager, balancing loads across multiple servers and 
providing security features such as SSL termination. This ensures your website or app runs smoothly and securely by handling incoming traffic before it reaches your servers.
============================================================================================================================================================================
Question.8)	 what is loadbalancers and its lb rule.

A Load Balancer distributes incoming traffic across multiple servers to ensure no single server gets overwhelmed. LB Rules (Load Balancer Rules) define how this traffic 
should be distributed, such as directing requests to different servers based on factors like their availability or workload. This setup helps keep your application 
running efficiently and reliably.
